# <u>Carrera's Unit01-Github Fundamentals README.md assignment.</u>

### Hello üòÑ

### Thank you for taking the time to review my README markdown (README.md) file as part of my first assignment: **_Unit 01 Github Fundamentals_**.

Below I have outlined a few of the topics I have learned so far as a student of the **_Black Codher Full-stack Developer Course_** and what I have found confusing or, for that matter, what still confuses me.üôÉ
Below, I have listed what I have been taught as sub-sections and have provided a brief explanation for each topic to demonstrate my understanding of that particular learned topic.

In the famous words of a human..".._happy reading_" (anonymous, 2022).üìñ

#### ‚ùì<u>What is software development</u>‚ùì

‚òùÔ∏èThe first thing to note is that there are different types of software development:

- Mobile application
- Software engineering
- Web application development
- Video game development
- Web development

[Software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) is focused on computer programmes for mobile devices and desktops. Web development focuses on developing computer programmes for mobile devices and desktops, meaning that a web developer's primary concerns relate to web applications and websites that function on the internet browser.

#### ‚ùì<u>What are examples of front-end coding languages?</u>‚ùì

HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and JavaScript are examples of [front-end coding languages](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-design-html-css-javascript#:~:text=HTML%2C%20CSS%2C%20%26%20JavaScript%3A%20A%20Tutorial&text=HTML%20provides%20the%20basic%20structure,the%20behavior%20of%20different%20elements.) which work together. _HTML forms the basic structure of any web page, mainly the text, font, graphics and colours._ HTML is like the skeletonü¶¥ of a webpage. _CSS is a style sheet language that works with HTML to improve any web page's visual look and feel_.üé® If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin, whilst _Javascript, the language which improves a webpage's maintainability_, as well as other features like drop-down menus, contact forms and modal windows, would be the muscle.ü¶æ

#### ‚ùì<u>What are examples of back-end programming languages?</u>‚ùì

Examples of [back-end programming languages](https://sagaratechnology.medium.com/what-languages-are-used-for-back-end-development-71a8a10c135c) are Python, PHP, and Java.these programming languages work on the side of any website that you don't see and are responsible for collating, storing and organising data that allows all the aspects of the client side to work correctly. So next time you fill out an online contact form, make an online purchase or even type in your favourite URL, that's the handy work of back-end programming.

#### ‚ùì<u>What is a full stack developer‚ùì ‚ùìWhat are some coding languages used by a full-stack developer?</u>‚ùì

[A full-stack developer](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) is a professional name given to a developer who designs, develops and maintains client and server software by working on both the front-end and back-end development processes. A full-stack developer is proficient in front-end coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and back-end programming languages such as Python, PHP, and JavaScript. In addition, a full-stack developer utilises multiple coding and programming languages to provide users (aka the client or the site viewer) with the interactive technical delivery required to ensure that whatever we view works correctly every time.

Think of it like this, When you look at a fashion magazine online, and you can see pictures, sounds and videos, those visuals that you see on your interface (aka screen) have been made possible by using front-end coding languages. Let's now say you see the garment in the online magazine and want to know where and how to make a purchase whilst staying on that same page. You can simultaneously view which clothing store sells the garment you wish to buy, its price and size availability and make an instant purchase. All require a developer to use back-end programming to make that possible for you so that your user interface (UI) experience runs smoothly, giving you peace of mind.üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's a win-win if you ask me.ü§úü§õ

#### ‚ùì<u>What is a software development life cycle</u>‚ùì

Now, let's go back a few steps and pretend that the above example is the first of its kind and does not yet exist on planet Earth. So, the full-stack developer and other team members must find a way to make this brilliant idea a reality through a developmental process that allows them to work smart and efficiently and just like that, along comes the Eureka moment! The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a common framework used by development teams to produce high-quality software in cost-effective and systematic ways.

I have learned that there are six stages to the SDLC which are:

- Planning (conceiving)
- Analysis (specifying)
- Design
- Implementation (programming)
- Testing and Integration
- Maintenance (bug fixes)

#### ‚ùì<u>What are the SDLC methodologies?</u>‚ùì

Think of the SDLC methodology as processes and practices widely used by development teams to assist in the successful management and navigation of the SDLC itself. The most dominant SDLC methodology currently being used within professional organisations is **_The Agile methodology._**
Agile is an iterative method to project management which assists groups in providing value to their clients quicker. The Agile Methodology splits a project into multiple cycles that pass through all or some of the SDLC phases.

The Agile cycle is as follows: Requirements‚û°Ô∏è Design‚û°Ô∏è Develop‚û°Ô∏è Test‚û°Ô∏è Deploy

The Agile methodology emphasises people (teams) and how they collaborate to complete a project or multiple projects. Below are examples of more SDLC methodologies:

- Waterfall
- Spiral
- Lean
- Iterative
- DevOps

#### ‚ùì<u>What is source code and source control?</u>‚ùì

Any collection of code produced in a human-readable, plain text computer language is considered source code.
Source control is the practice of tracking and controlling changes to source code. It also enables users to carry out regular back-ups of the code, which makes reverting to previous codes easy.

#### ‚ùì<u>What are the benefits of source control</u>‚ùì

For any development team, source control (aka version control, revision control or source code management) makes it possible to maintain that single source of truth which in turn assists developers in working efficiently. Through a source code management system, teams of developers can collaborate on codes and isolate their work until all the codes are ready to go. Source code management also greatly assists the troubleshooting process and can identify who made what changes and when.

#### ‚ùì<u>What are examples of source control management systems</u>‚ùì

Many examples of source control management systems are currently being used worldwide. Some source control management systems' enable multiple team members to mirror the same code base onto their local computers and make changes to the code without the need to be connected to the internet. In this case, such a system that facilitates the working of a codebase in offline mode is a Distributed system. On the other hand, a centralised system requires team members to access the main codebase from one file. Any official changes won't be accounted for and updated unless an internet connection exists.

Here are a few source control management systems below:

- [AWS Codecommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/guides/getting-started/overview#a-brief-overview-of-bitbucket)
- [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/features.html)
- [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/about)
- [Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fget-started%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fget-started%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-devops)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/why-gitlab/)
- [GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E&feature=youtu.be)

#### ‚ùì<u>What is the difference between Git and GitHub</u>‚ùì

Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and track the history of your source code. GitHub is a cloud-hosted service that enables you to manage Git repositories.

#### ‚ùì<u>What is a command-line</u>‚ùì

A command line is a computer user interface that uses text. The command line is a screen with a blank line and a cursor where the user may enter commands for instant execution. Some [popular operating systems include Windows, Apple macOS, Google's AndroidOS, and Linux](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/5-most-popular-operating-systems1910.html#close).

Other essential skills I have learned so far are remote teamwork and team-building, how to use Git help, Slack, Visual Studio code and above all, [how to make toast](https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_got_a_wicked_problem_first_tell_me_how_you_make_toast?language=en) üçû

If you were to ask me what I find confusing so far based on what I have learned, I would say everything; until I can explain all of the above as fluently and efforlessly as I can sing my favourite song with my eyes closed, I know that I need further traiing and studying to reach that goal.‚ò∫Ô∏è

By the way, I almost forgot to mention what you have just viewed in my README.md file is my demonstration of a pretty cool feature that I have recently learned about as part of my full-stack developer course called ['_Markdown_'](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)ü§ì
